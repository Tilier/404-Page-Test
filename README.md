# 404-Page-Test
A test for if different folders can have different 404s.

# Initial test 1:
  Failed.
  
  Tried putting different 404s in different folders. Unfortunately, did not work D:
  
# Test 2:
  It works!
  I mixed the two up but that is okay!!!!!! Yeah baby!
  
  Using Javascript and pathname to get the folder, create unused .txt files so that the folders don't delete themseleves.
